Networking Practice
===================

# Goal
The purpose of this repository is for me to practice with networking (mainly using the Asio library) and concurrency.

Code inspired from the following sources:
- Asio tutorials from [asio C++ library](https://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.30.2/doc/asio/tutorial.html) and [One Lone Coder](https://onelonecoder.com)
- _C++ Concurrency In Action_ by _Anthony Williams_

# Status
Work In Progress
